        <h1>Assignment 6</h1>
        <p> Assignment 6's goal was to familiarlize ourselves with overlays. The parameters were as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the image loads correctly</li>
            <li>2 separate overlays were present on the image</li>
            <li>Correct html boiler plate was followed and CSS was linked properly </li>
            <li>HTML passes W3C validation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the point where I was becoming more familiar with html and was able to move on to more challening ideas, 
            such as being able to make sure everything renders as expected and control positioning </p>
